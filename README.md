## Welcome to my solution to The Bridge's data technical test. To be able to run all files you will need to complete the following steps:


- Run in your terminal the following command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Create a file named `config.py` in folder `utils` an create the following variables with their respect key collected from API Twitter and be able to connect with the MySQL host:
    - `API_KEY` to insert your public api key

    - `SECRET_API_KEY` to insert your private api key

    - `BEARER_TOKEN` to insert your bearer token

    - `ACCESS_TOKEN` to insert your access token

    - `ACCESS_SECRET_TOKEN` to insert your secret access token

    - `HOST` for the host of the MySQL 

    - `USER` for the user of the MySQL connection

    - `PASSWORD` MySQL connection password

### If you want to use the API from `app.py` you only need to run the script and use the correct endpoint

Enjoy it!
